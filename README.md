This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What's Missing?

I've tried to cover most of the requirements with this project, there are some aspects missing I'd like to include but ran out of time: 
- Working with exponent, math is clearly wrong in my logic.
- Media queries.
- Formatting the value INSIDE the amount input box. 
- Better validation around input.
- Inline execution of formatting.
